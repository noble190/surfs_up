# Module 9 Challenge

## Analysis Overview
This project involves analyzing historical temperature data for Hawaii. We will be comparing a number of statistics computed for the months of June and December, and making recommendations for future analysis.

### December:

### Key differences
* There are fewer obervations taken in December than in June: 1517 compared to 1700, respectively.
* The mean temperature for December is slightly lower than in June: 71° compared to 74.9°.
* The minumum temperature for December is noticeably lower than in June: 56° compared to  64°. The maximum temperatures are similar: 83° compared to 85°.

## Summary

### Results summary
The dataset used provides a sufficient number of observations per month for credible analysis. 

While at a glance, the average temperature between the months of June and December may seem similar (with a difference of a mere 3.9°), the minimum temperature can be noticeably lower in December (a significant difference of 8°). The data shows that December is a viable month for surfing, but we'd recommend that surfers check the day's forecast before going out (in case of a rare day of noticeably colder weather).

The maximum temperatures are quite close, and should not have a significant impact on the comfort of propspective surfers.

### Recommendation for additional queries
* The dataset provided also contains data on precipitation. It may be worthwhile to perform a similar analysis for the two chosen months, as precipitation may be an important factor to surfer comfort.
* Currently, we are analyzing data for all weather stations. It may be worthwhile to restrict the list to the stations that have surf spots nearby, in order to provide a more accurate analysis for surfers.
